## Laravel Microsoft Teams Connector

A Laravel 5 package to send notifications to Microsoft Teams by using "Incoming Webhook". 
This package also contains a card to send a Laravel Forge deployment notification, because Microsoft Teams notification is not supported at the moment.

## Package Installation - Composer

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require sebbmeyer/laravel-teams-connector
```

### Laravel
If you are using Laravel 5.5 and up, the service provider will automatically get registered.

For older versions of Laravel (<5.5), you have to add the service provider and alias to config/app.php:

```php
Sebbmyr\LaravelTeams\TeamsConnectorServiceProvider::class,
```

You can optionally use the facade for shorter code. Add this to your facades:

```php
'TeamsConnector' => Sebbmyr\LaravelTeams\Facades\TeamsConnector::class,
```

### Lumen

For Lumen usage, the service provider should be registered manually by adding the following line in `bootstrap/app.php`:  

```php
$app->register(Sebbmyr\LaravelTeams\TeamsConnectorServiceProvider::class);
```

### Configuration

For this package to work, you need to configure an "Incomming Webhook" connector in your targeted Teams channel and copy the url into a config file that you can publish like this:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Sebbmyr\LaravelTeams\TeamsConnectorServiceProvider"
```

... or you simple add the following to your `.env` file:

```
MICROSOFT_TEAMS_WEBHOOK=<incoming_webhook_url>
```

### Usage

How to send simple notification look at the readme of this package [sebbmeyer/php-microsoft-teams-connector](https://github.com/sebbmeyer/php-microsoft-teams-connector)

### Custom card - ForgeCard

You can create your own cards for every purpose you need, just extend the **AbstractCard** class and implement the `getMessage()` function.

```php
\\ Sebbmyr\LaravelTeams\Cards\ForgeCard.php
public function getMessage()
{
    return [
        "@type" => "MessageCard",
        "@context" => "http://schema.org/extensions",
        "summary" => "Forge Card",
        "themeColor" => ($this->data["status"] === 'success') ? self::STATUS_SUCCESS : self::STATUS_ERROR,
        "title" => "Forge deployment message",
        "sections" => [
            [
                "activityTitle" => "",
                "activitySubtitle" => "",
                "activityImage" => "",
                "facts" => [
                    [
                        "name" => "Server:",
                        "value" => $this->data["server"]['name']
                    ],
                    [
                        "name" => "Site",
                        "value" => "[". $this->data["site"]["name"] ."](http://". $this->data["site"]["name"] .")"
                    ],                        [
                        "name" => "Commit hash:",
                        "value" => "[". $this->data["commit_hash"] ."](". $this->data["commit_url"] .")"
                    ],
                    [
                        "name" => "Commit message",
                        "value" => $this->data["commit_message"]
                    ]
                ],
                "text" => ($this->data["status"] === 'success') ? $this->data["commit_author"] ." deployed some fresh code!" : "Something went wrong :/"
            ]
        ]
    ];
}
```
